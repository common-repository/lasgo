$more_comments = '<p>The Table of Comments displays all the comments, with the most recent comment displayed first.</p><p>The checkbox that particular comment to be processed by a Bulk Action.</p><p>Gravatar is a picture or gravatar of the comment author.</p><p>Author is the name of the comment author. Below the comment author name is the comment author email address that can be clicked to begin an email to that address. Below the email address is the commenter web-site in the form of a URL that can be click to visit that commenters web-site. Below the email address is commenter IP address in the form of a link. Clicking that IP address link causes all the comments originated by that IP address to be displayed thus allowing a Bulk Action to be applied to all comments from that address.</p><p>The first item in the Comment column is the comment date and time presented as a link. Click the date and time link to allow the comment to be edited in the Comments Edit Screen. Below the date and time is the actual comment that was submitted, and below that is the Immediate Actions that can be performed on that comment.</p><p>In Response To column displays the title of the post related to the comment. Click the post title to edit that post. Below the post title, a comment bubble depicts the number of comments made to the post. Place the mouse cursor (Hover) over the comment bubble to see how many of the comments are in a Pending state. And finally, next the comment bubble, a # (pound sign/hash symbol) is displayed as a link to see a single post view of the post related to the comments. </p><h3>Sortable Columns</h3><p>Some column headings, such as the Author, and In Response To, can be clicked to sort the Table of Comments in ascending or descending order. Hover over the column title, for example Title, to see the up-arrow or down-arrow. Click the heading to change the sort order.</p><h3>Page Navigation</h3><p>Under the Screen Options, the number of Comments displayed per page is determined. If more then one page of Comments is available, two double-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided. Also two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or forward. Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to enter a page to directly display.</p><h3>Screen Options</h3><p>The Screen Options allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column. Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column. In addition, the number of items you want displayed in the table can be set. Choose 1 to 999. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.</p><h3>Search</h3><p>Above the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and click the Search Comments button to search and display all the comments meeting your search words.</p><h3>Filtering Options</h3><p>At the top of this Screen are links such as All, Pending, Approved, Spam, and Trash, that when clicked, will cause just the comments of that type to be displayed in the underlying Table.</p><p>Below that and to the right of the Bulk Actions Apply button, is another filter option.</p><h3>Show all comment types</h3><p>This dropdown allows you to select, by date, which Posts are displayed in the Table of Comments. By default, Show all comment types is selected and all of the comments are displayed. Besides all comment types, this pulldown offers the ability to filter just comments or just pings. </p><h3>Using Selection, Actions, and Apply</h3><p>This Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more comments selected in the Table. </p><p>To select a comment, the checkbox to the left of the comment entry must be checked (clicked). It is possible to keep selecting more comments by checking their respective checkbox.</p><p>All comments in a given table can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Table title, or footer bar. Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar checkbox will cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT selected).</p><p>A Reverse Selection means checked items become unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse Selection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and clicking the header or footer title bar checkbox. </p><h3>Actions</h3><p>Actions describe the process to be performed on particular comments. There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as Bulk Actions and Immediate Actions. </p><p>These Actions can be performed on one, or more comments, at one time, if those comments have been previously selected. Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Bulk Actions pulldown box, above the Table. The Bulk Actions allowed are Unapprove, Approve, Mark as Spam, and Move to Trash.</p><p>Immediate Actions are performed immediately, on an individual comment. When the mouse cursor is moved over (hover) a comment, in the Comment column, under the comment itself the Immediate Actions of Unapprove, Reply, Quick Edit, Edit, Spam, and Trash appear as links. Click one of those links to initiate the corresponding Immediate Action. </p><p>Approve/Unapprove is shared by one link. If a comment is currently in an approved state then this link shows as Unapprove (in orange), but if the comment is Unapproved this link shows as Approve (in green). Clicking the Approve or Unapprove link changes the comment to the opposite status. Both Approve and Unapprove are available as Bulk Actions.</p><p>Reply is available only as an Immediate Action. Clicking action cause the Reply to Comment edit window to display below the current comment and a reply to that comment can be made and save when the Submit Reply button is clicked.</p><p>Quick Edit is an Immediate Action that allows a quick in-line edit of the comment. See the Quick Edit section for details on this Action.</p><p>Edit is an Immediate Action, initiated by click on the comment time and date, or clicking on the Edit option just below the comment, causes the Comments Edit Screen to display.</p><p>Spam is shown in red, and marks the comment as spam. Spam is available both as a Bulk Action, and an Immediate Action. See the Spam section for details on this Action.</p><p>Trash is shown in red, and sends the comment to the trash bin. Comments sent to the Trash later be restored or deleted permanently. Trash is available both as a Bulk Action, and an Immediate Action. See the Trash section for details on this Action. </p><h3>Quick Edit</h3><p>Quick Edit is an Immediate Action performed on one comment by clicking the Quick Edit link, under the comment in the Table of Comments. Quick Edit is just an in-line edit that allows you to change the following item Name of commenter, Email of commenter, URL of commenter, and the comment.</p><h3>Spam</h3><p>Once a comment has been marked as Spam, that comment and other Spam comments can be accessed via the Spam Filtering link above the Table of Comments.

$more_themes = '<p>Fundamentally, the WordPress Theme system is a way to skin your weblog. Yet, it is more than just a skin. Skinning your site implies that only the design is changed. WordPress Themes can provide much more control over the look and presentation of the material on your website.</p><p>A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (.jpg, .gif), style sheets (.css), custom Pages, as well as any necessary code files (.php). For an introduction to template files, see Stepping Into Templates.</p><h3>Get New Themes</h3><p>The WordPress Theme Directory is the official site for WordPress Themes which have been checked and inspected, and are free for downloading. The site features the ability to search by type and style, and offers a demonstration of the page view elements of the Theme.</p><p><h3>Using Themes</h3></p><p>WordPress comes with two themes; the default Twenty Thirteen theme and the previous default, Twenty Twelve theme. You can switch between Themes using the admin panel. Themes that you add to the theme directory will appear in the Administration Panels > Design > Themes as additional selections.</p><h3>Adding New Themes</h3><p>There are many Themes available for download that will work with your WordPress installation. If the Theme that you are installing provides instructions, be sure to read through and follow those instructions for the successful installation of the Theme. It is recommended that Theme developers provide installation instructions for their own Themes, because Themes can provide special optional functionality that may require more steps than the basic installation steps covered here. If your Theme does not work after following any provided instructions, please contact the Theme author for help.</p><p>Use the sub-menu or the Search or Filter options to locate a Theme you would like to use. Click on the Preview link to preview the Theme or the Install link to upload the Theme to your blog.</p><p>Use the Upload link in the top sub-menu to upload a zipped copy of a Theme that you have previously downloaded to your machine. </p><p>You can also add new themes by using FTP or your cPanel. Just upload and unzip your theme in the wp-content folder. Then come back here to activate it.</p><h3>Creating Themes</h3><p>If you are interested in creating your own Theme for distribution, or learning more about the architecture of Themes, please review the documentation regarding <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development" target="_blank">Theme Development</a>.</p><p>If you simply want to customize your current Theme for your own use, consider creating a Child Theme.</p>';
$more_widgets = '<p>Widget is a fancy word for tools or content that you can add, arrange, and remove from the sidebar(s) of your blog. Widgets make it easy to customize the content of your sidebar(s). You can learn more about the widgets we offer by checking out the Related links on the right.</p><h3>Adding Widgets</h3><p>To add a widget, drag the widget from the Available Widgets or Inactive Widgets area on the left into the Sidebar area on the right. When you see a dashed line appear, you can drop the widget into place. You can also change the order of the widgets by dragging and dropping them around in the sidebar.</p><h3>Configuring Widgets</h3><p>Each widget has configuration options. To make changes to a widget in the sidebar, click on the triangle on the right side.</p><p>This will open up the options for the widget. Each widget will be different. Here is an example of the Archives widget.</p><p>After you have have configured the widget, click the Save button. Clicking the Close link will minimize the configuration options again.</p><h3>Widget Visibility</h3><p>Widgets can be configured to appear only on certain pages (or be hidden on certain pages) by using the Visibility panel. The Visibility button is next to the Save button.</p><p>Visibility is controlled by five aspects: page type, category, tag, date, and author. For example, if you wanted the Archives widget to only appear on category archives and error pages, choose Show from the first dropdown and then add two rules: Page is 404 Error Page and Category is All Category Pages.</p><p>You can also hide widgets based on the current page. For example, if you do not want the Archives widget to appear on search results pages, choose Hide and Page is Search Results.</p><p>Each visibility rule is handled separately. There isn not a way, for example, to only display a widget on posts that are categorized as Summer and also tagged with Picnic.</p><h3>Removing Widgets</h3><<p>If you would like to remove a widget from the sidebar, click the Delete link in the configuration options as show above.</p><h3>Accessibility Mode</h3><p>If you need a more accessible way to add widgets, click Screen Options ? Enable accessibility mode to turn off the drag and drop feature.</p><p>In accessibility mode, you can add widgets to your sidebar using the Add links next to each widget name.</p><h3>Troubleshooting</h3><p>Why are there widgets showing up on my blog that are not listed under my sidebar on the Appearance  Widgets screen.</p><p>With some themes if you have not added any widgets to your sidebar(s), the theme will show a default set of widgets, which will not be listed in the Sidebar area.</p><p>When you add widget(s) to a sidebar the default set of widgets will no longer be used. Try adding a blank Text Widget if you do not want anything to show up in a widget area.</p>';
$more_navmenus = '<p>The Appearance Menus Screen enables a user to create custom navigation menu in place of a theme default menu. Support for this feature must be registered in the theme functions.php file. The WordPress Menu User Guide describes the details of addings, deleting, and maintaining menus.</p><h3>Screen Options</h3><p>The Screen Options allow you to choose which modules are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Screen. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the possible modules and options with a check-box next to each. Check the box for each module or option you want displayed, or uncheck the box to not display that module. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.</p><p>Certain modules, like Posts are hidden by default.</p><h3>Expanding, Collapsing, and Rearranging, Modules</h3><p>The modules, such as Posts, can be expanded, or collapsed, by clicking on the module title bar. In addition, those modules can be moved by hovering the mouse cursor over the module title bar, when the mouse cursor changes to 4 arrows, hold the left mouse button down, drag the module to where you want to place it, then release the mouse button (this is called drag-and-drop).</p><h3>Create a Menu</h3><p>To create a new custom menu, click on the plus tab, give the menu a name, and click Create Menu button.</p><p>If the current theme does not support menus, a message will appear. Just add it as custom menu widget in Widgets.</p><p>You can create multiple menus. If your theme includes support for more than one menu, you can choose which custom menu to associate with each. You can also use custom menus in conjunction with the Custom Menus widget.</p><p>Delete Menu deletes the menu. Deleting also deletes the menu items. </p><p>Automatically add new top-level pages box so that anytime a new top-level Page is created, that Page will automatically be added to the menu.</p><p>Save menu button saves the menu. </p><h3>Add Menu Items</h3><p>After a menu is created, then detail items can be added to the menu. Choose items like custom links, pages, and categories, from the left column to add to the menu. If you have created custom post types or custom taxonomies those too can be added to menus. If you do not see your custom post types or taxonomies, look under the Screen Options to make sure they are checked to be Show on Screen.</p><p>After items have been added to a menu, drag and drop to put them in the order you want. You can also click each item to reveal additional configuration options. You can also drag a menu item a little to the right to make it a submenu, to create menus with hierarchy. You will see when the position of the drop target shifts over to portray the nested placement. When you have finished building your custom menu, make sure you click the Save Menu button.</p><p>You can specify a different navigation label for a menu item as well as other attributes. You can create multiple menus. If your theme includes more than one menu, you can choose which custom menu to associate with each. You can also use custom menus in conjunction with the Custom Menus widget.</p><p>This screenshot shows an example of the About Menu Item displayed in a hierarchy under the Home Menu Item.</p><h3>Maintaining a Menu</h3><p>Theme locations allow the definition of the placement of your menu. The WordPress Twenty Twelve theme supports one menu location so the message (If you have added support for more navigation menus in your theme, you will see more pull-down location options)</p><p>From the pull down box, select the menu that will be presented in the location such as Primary Location.</p><h3>Custom Links</h3><p>Custom links allow links defined by you that do not fit into the other types of menu items. Enter the URL of the custom link, label, and click Add to Menu.</p><p>Once added to the menu, the item will display to the right with the label, the word Custom and a configuration arrow that can be used to change the URL or Label as well as Remove the custom link from the menu.</p><h3>Posts</h3><p>Links to specific posts can be added to the menu. Three tabs, Most Recent, View All, and Search, determines what posts are displayed for selection as a menu item.</p><p>Check the box next to the item to add to the menu. Select All cause the Checkbox to be checked on all items. If you click this link again, all items will be unchecked. </p><p>Add to Menu button adds the selected items to the menu. </p><h3>Pages</h3><p>Links to specific pages can be added to the menu. Three tabs, Most Recent, View All, and Search, determines what posts are displayed for selection as a menu item. When the View All tab is displayed, a Home choice, while not an actual page, also becomes available to add to the menu. The Checkbox, Select All, and Add to Menu options, describe in the Posts section, are also displayed in this module.</p><h3>Categories</h3><p>Categories can also be added to the menu. Three tabs, Most Recent, View All, and Search, determines what categories are displayed for selection as a menu item. The list of categories to select from do not display with any hierarchy, though that may be subject to change in future versions of WordPress. The Checkbox, Select All, and Add to Menu options, describe in the Posts section, are also displayed in this module.</p><h3>Post Tags</h3><p>Post Tags can also be added to menus. Three tabs, Most Recent, View All, and Search, determines what categories are displayed for selection as a menu item. The Checkbox, Select All, and Add to Menu options, describe in the Posts section, are also displayed in this module.</p><h3>Custom Post Types and Taxonomies</h3><p>If you have added custom post types and taxonomies, those types will also be available to add as menu items. If you do not see your custom post types or taxonomies, check the Screen Options to ensure those modules are set to display. The options under each of the custom post type and taxonomy modules correspond to those used for Posts, Pages, Categories, and Post Tags.</p><h3>Rearranging, Configuring, and Deleting Menu Items</h3><p>Once an item is added to a menu, those menu items can be rearranged. Placing the mouse cursor over the menu item title, when the mouse cursor changes to 4-arrows, hold the left-mouse button down, drag the module to where you want to place it, then release the mouse button (this is called drag-and-drop). Remember you can drag a menu item slightly to the right of the menu item above it to create a hierarchy (parent/child) relationship in the menu.</p><p>Each Menu Item has a configuration arrow on the right side of the Menu Item title, that when clicked opens the configuration box. Click the arrow a second time closed the configuration box. If you do not see Link Target, CSS Classes, Link Relationship (XFN), and Description, then under Screen Options make sure those boxes are checked to expose them here.</p><p>The Navigation Label is the label for this particular menu item. Title Attribute is the attribute(link hover comment) used when displaying the label. In Link Target you can choose Select Same window or tab or New window or tab from the pulldown. You can also enter optional CSS Classes for this menu item.</p><p>Link Relationship (XFN) allows for the generation of XFN attributes automatically so you can show how you are related to the authors/owners of site to which you are linking. The description will be displayed in the menu if the current theme supports it. </p><p>Original is a link to the original source of the menu item (e.g. a link to view the post or page). You can also Remove this menu item from the menu or Cancel the configuration of the menu item.</p><h3>Adding Menu Support to Themes</h3><p>The WordPress Twenty Twelve theme supports navigation Menus. If your theme does not support the custom menu feature, you can do it yourself by adding the appropriate code to your theme function.php file. To implement Menus for a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Navigation_Menus">theme read more</a>.</p>';
$more_plugins = '<p>The Plugins Screen enables you to manage your Plugins. Management of Plugins entails activating, deactivating, updating, editing, and deleting Plugins that are installed. Visit the Plugins Add New Screen to install new plugins.</p><h3>Manage Plugins</h3><p>Once a plugin is installed, you may activate it, deactivate it, edit the Plugin file, delete the Plugin, or Upgrade the Plugin. As a special note regarding the Plugin Upgrade process--when Plugins need to be updated, the left navigation menu Plugin option will display a Red balloon, with a number inside the balloon. That number represents the number of Plugins that need to be Updated.</p><p>On visiting the Plugins Screen, there may be a splash warning message, similar to, The plugin has been deactivated due to an error: xxxxxxxxxxxx. If such a message is displayed, investigation is required to find out why a particular Plugin was deactivaed. Possible causes for the deactivation are, (1) an incomplete set of plugin files, (2) the plugin is coded incorrectly, or (3) the Plugin is dependent on another Plugin, and that Plugin is missing, deactivated, or has problems.</p><h3>Using Selection, Actions, and Apply</h3><p>The various Tables in this Screen allow Actions to be performed on one or more Plugins. For Actions to be performed on multiple Plugins at once, those Plugins must be first selected via a method.</p><p>Select one Plugin at a time method when the checkbox to the left of the Plugin entry is checked (clicked). It is possible to keep selecting more Plugins by checking their respective checkbox.</p><p>Select all Plugins in given Table method when in a given table can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Table title, or footer bar. Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar checkbox will cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT selected).</p><p>A Reverse Selection means checked items become unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse Selection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and clicking the header or footer title bar checkbox. </p><h3>Actions</h3><p>Activate Action enables a Plugin, or better yet, turns the Plugin on. Activating a Plugin is necessary to use the features of a Plugin. Note that some Plugins make Widgets available for use in the Appearance Widgets Screen. Only Inactive Plugins can be activated. Activate can be either a Bulk Action, or an Immediate Action. </p><p>Successful activation will display a splash message at the top of the Screen (e.g. Plugin activated. or Selected plugins activated.) Failure to activate a Plugin results in the message Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error - this should be further investigated. Likely causes of failure are (1) an incomplete set of plugin files, (2) the plugin is coded incorrectly, (3) or the Plugin is dependent on another Plugin before it can be successfully activated. </p><p>Deactivate Action disables, or turns off, a Plugin. Only Active Plugins can be deactivated. Deactivate is either a Bulk Action, or an Immediate Action. </p><p>Successful deactivation will display a splash message at the top of the Screen (e.g. Plugin deactivated. or Selected plugins deactivated.) </p><p>Delete Action deletes the Plugins files. Only Inactive Plugins can be deleted. See the Deleting Plugins section for details of the deletion process. Delete is available only as a Bulk Action.</p><p>Upgrade is Immediate Action that initiates the Plugin upgrade process. See the Upgrading Plugins section for details on upgrading Plugins.</p><p>Edit is Immediate Action places the Plugin code in the Plugins Editor text box for editing. Warning: Making changes to active plugins is not recommended. If your changes cause a fatal error, the plugin will be automatically deactivated. See Plugins Editor for details on editing a Plugin. </p><h3>Apply</h3><p>After one or more Plugins are selected, and after a Bulk Action is specified, the Apply button performs the given Action on the selected Plugins. </p><p>Click the Apply button to execute the Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pulldown, on the selected Plugins. Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more Plugins must be selected, as described before. </p><p>Successful application of the Action is noted in a splash message at the top of the Screen. For instance, when the Activate Action is applied, the message Selected plugins activated." is displayed. </p><h3>Upgrading Plugins</h3><p>If a Plugin is hosted at the WordPress Extend Plugins site Upgrade notices will be displayed, when appropriate, for a given Plugin. If the Plugin is hosted elsewhere, such as the Plugin authors site, it is incumbent on you to check for available updates for those Plugins! </p><p>When a Plugin has an upgrade available, no matter in what Table (e.g. Currently Active Plugins) the Plugins resides, under each Plugin row, a message will be displayed.</p><h3>Currently Active Plugins</h3><p>This Table displays the list Plugins that are currently active. Note that each Active Plugin is displayed in a light green background. The Actions allowed in this Table are Deactivate, Edit, and Upgrade. </p><h3>Recently Active Plugins</h3><p>The Plugins listed in this table are Plugins that were recently deactivated. When a plugin has been inactive for more than 7 days it will be moved to the Inactive Plugins Table. The Actions allowed in this Table are Activate, Delete, Edit, and Upgrade.</p><p>Click the Clear List button to clear all the Plugins listed in this Table. The Table is not displayed again until another Plugin is deactived. </p><h3>Inactive Plugins</h3><p>Plugins listed here are installed, but inactive. The Actions of Activate, Delete, Edit, and Upgrade can be performed on Plugins in this Table. </p><h3>Get More Plugins</h3><p>You can find additional plugins for your site by using the new Plugin Browser/Installer functionality, or by browsing the WordPress Plugin Directory directly and installing manually. </p><p>To manually install a plugin you generally just need to upload the plugin file into your /htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/plugins directory.

$more_general = '<p>This Settings General Screen is the default Screen in the Settings Administration Screen and controls some of the most basic configuration settings for your site: your sites title and location, who may register an account at your site, and how dates and times are calculated and displayed.</p><h3>Site title</h3><p>Enter the name of your site (or blog) here. Most themes will display this title, at the top of every page, and in the readers browser titlebar. WordPress also uses this title as the identifying name for your Syndication feeds. </p><h3>Tagline</h3><p>In a few words, explain what your site is about. Your site slogan, or tagline, might be entered here. A tagline is short phrase, or sentence, used to convey the essence of the site and is often funny or eye-catching. </p><h3>WordPress Address (URL)</h3><p>Enter the full URL of the directory containing your WordPress core application files (e.g., wp-config.php, wp-admin, wp-content, and wp-includes). For example, if you installed WordPress into a directory called blog, then the WordPress address would be http://example.net/blog (where example.net is your domain). If you installed WordPress into your web root, this address will be the root URL http://example.net. WordPress will trim a slash (/) from the end. If you defined the WP_SITEURL constant in your wp-config.php file, that value will appear in this field and you will not be able to make changes to it from the WordPress administration screen. </p><h3>Site Address (URL)</h3><p>Enter the address you want people to type in their browser to reach your WordPress site. This is the directory where WordPresss main index.php file is installed. The Site address (URL) is identical to the WordPress address (URL) (above) unless you are giving WordPress its own directory. WordPress will trim a slash (/) from the end. If you defined the WP_HOME constant in your wp-config.php file, that value will appear in this field and you will not be able to make changes to it from the WordPress administration screen. </p><h3>Email Address</h3><p>Enter the e-mail address to which you want WordPress to send messages regarding the administration and maintenance of your WordPress site. For example, if you allow new users to register as a member of your site (see Membership below), then a notification will be sent through e-mail to this address. In addition, if the option, An administrator must always approve the comment, is set in Administration > Settings > Discussion, this e-mail address will receive notification that the comment is being held for moderation. Please note this is different than the address you supplied for the admin user account; the admin account e-mail address is sent an e-mail only when someone submits a comment to a post by admin. The address you enter here will never be displayed on the site. </p><h3>Membership</h3><p>Anyone can register - Check this checkbox if you want anyone to be able to register an account on your site. </p><h3>New User Default Role</h3><p>This pull-down box allows you to select the default Role that is assigned to new users. This Default Role will be assigned to newly registered members or users added via the Administration > Users > Users Screen. Valid choices are Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, or Subscriber. </p><h3>Timezone</h3><p>From the pulldown box, choose a city in the same timezone as you. For example, under America, select New York if you reside in the Eastern Timezone of the United States that honors daylight savings times. If you cant identify a city in your timezone, select one of the Etc GMT settings that represents the number of hours by which your time differs from Greenwich Mean Time. Click the Save Changes button and the UTC time and Local time will display to confirm the correct Timezone was selected. </p><h3>Date Format</h3><p>The format in which to display dates on your site. The Date Format setting is intended to be used by theme designers in displaying dates on your site, but does not control how the date is displayed in the Administrative Screens (e.g. Manage Posts). Click the Save Changes button and the Output example below will show the current date in the format entered. See Formatting Date and Time for some of the formats available. </p><h3>Time Format</h3><p>The format in which to display times on your site. The Time Format setting is intended to be used by theme designers in displaying time on your site, but does not control how the time is displayed in the Administrative Screens (e.g. Write Post edit of timestamp). Click the Save Changes button and the Output example below will show the current time in the format entered. See Formatting Date and Time for some of the formats available. </p><h3>Week Starts On</h3><p>Select your preferred start date for WordPress calendars from the drop-down box. Monday is the default setting for this drop-down, meaning a monthly calendar will show Monday in the first column. If you want your calendar to show Sunday as the first column, then select Sunday from the drop-down. </p><h3>Save Changes</h3><p>Click the Save Changes button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database.

Selecting a size does NOT limit the size of the actual post; if you write a post that is longer than the size of the textbox, the textbox will generate a scrollbar. A small textbox means everything will fit nicely on your screen, a large textbox means you wont have to scroll as much when writing longer posts. </p><h3>Formatting</h3><p>You can use these checkboxes to control some of your blog formatting.</p><p>Convert emoticons will convert all of the emoticons in your posts into graphical smilies.</p><p>WordPress should correct invalidly nested XHTML automatically - Checking this helps make sure that what you write in your posts is valid XHTML code. You should probably check this box since invalid code sometimes causes problems with web browsers. Note: some Plugins may not work correctly when this feature is turned on. </p><h3>Default Post Category</h3><p>The Category you select from this drop-down is called the default post Category. The default post Category is Category assigned to a post if you fail to assign any other Categories with writing your posts. If you delete a Category, the posts in that Category will be assigned the default post Category. If you have several Categories, but use one of those Categories more frequently, select that Category here to make your life a little easier. </p><h3>Default Post Format</h3><p>The Post Format you select from this drop-down is called the default Post Format. Post Formats are used by themes to create different styling for different types of posts. This settings is only visible if the current activated theme supports Post Formats. The WordPress Twenty Twelve theme is an example of a theme that supports various Post Formats including Standard (no special format), Aside, and Gallery. </p><h3>Default Link Category</h3><p>The Category you select from this dropdown will be the default Link Category checked when you create new Links. If you have several Categories, but assign one Category more frequently to Links, select that Category. </p><h3>Press This</h3><p>Press This is a bookmarklet: a little app that runs in your browser and lets you grab bits of the web. </p><p>Use Press This to clip text, images and videos from any web page.

Any mail received at this address will be posted, so it is a good idea to keep this address very secret. Here are three random strings you could use: FKZXx8EK, P6snQ5Lq, YcrfBw03. </p><h3>Mail Server</h3><p>A mail server receives e-mails on your behalf and stores them for retrieval. Your mail server will have a URI address, such as mail.example.com, which you should enter here. </p><h3>Port</h3><p>Servers usually use port 110 to receive requests related to emails. If your mail server uses a different port, enter that port number here. </p><h3>Login Name</h3><p>If, for example, the e-mail address that you will be using for the writing by e-mail feature is wordpress@example.com, then wordpress is the Login name. </p><h3>Password</h3><p>Enter the password for the above e-mail address here. Three possible passwords are displayed by WordPress in the introduction section of this Screen. </p><h3>Default Mail Category</h3><p>WordPress will assign this Category to all of the posts published via the Post by e-mail feature. Note: You can create new Categories in Administration > Posts > Categories. </p><h3>Update Services</h3><p>When you publish a new post, WordPress automatically notifies the update services of the sites listed in the box. For more about this, see Update Services on the Codex. When entering services, separate multiple URIs with line breaks. If your Privacy Settings Blog Visibility is set to I would like to block search engines, but allow normal visitors, the message WordPress is not notifying any Update Services because of your blogs privacy settings is displayed. </p><h3>Save Changes</h3><p>Click the Save Changes button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database.

If you dont wish to allow comments uncheck this setting. </p><h3>Other comment settings </h3><p>Comment author must fill out name and email as a way to force spammers to do a bit of extra work. In reality, the name and email address are not verified in any way prior to the comment being submitted. Most legitimate commenters are more than willing to fill out a name and email address.</p><p>Users must be registered and logged in to comment if checked, only logged in registered users will be able to write comments on your site.</p><p>Automatically close comments on articles older than X days and enter the number of days (e.g. 14 days) after which WordPress will automatically flag eligible posts so that no more comments are accepted.</p><p>Enable threaded (nested) comments X levels deep to enable threaded comments, then from the dropdown box, select the number of levels deep (maximum of 10 levels) you will allow for nested comments. Note that themes need to be specially coded to properly display threaded comments.</p><p>Break comments into pages with top level comments per page and the last or first page displayed by default. Comments should be displayed with the older/newer comments at the top of each page  Check this box to cause comments to display in a paginated format with the specified number of comments per page. In addition, specify if the pages should be ordered first to last or last to first, and within each page, whether the oldest, or newest, comment is to be displayed first. </p><h3>Email me whenever </h3><p>These two settings give you control of when authors and administrators receive notification that comments have been made, or that comments are held for moderation. Please note that the use of me refers to either a post author or the administrator (person whose email address is used for admin purposes). </p><p>Anyone posts a comment so that every single comment posted will generate an email to the author of that post. Be warned that if your posts receive a large number of comments, post authors may find a very full email Inbox. If you wish to micromanage comments, then by all means, activate this setting by checking the box.</p><p>A comment is held for moderation if you want WordPress to send notification that a comment is being held for moderation. The email notification is sent to the Email address listed in the Administration > Settings > General Screen. This is useful if your blog has multiple authors and each author is authorized to allow or decline comments. That way, you, the owner of the site, can review what comments are being allowed or denied. </p><h3>Before a comment appears </h3><p>These settings provide you even more control over the instances of when and how comments are posted. </p><p>An administrator must always approve the comment to force comments to be approved by a blog user or owner having the proper Role to approve comments, even if the comments appear to be spam . See the Comment Moderation options below regarding spam. </p><p>Comment author must have a previously approved comment to insure comments are only posted if the comment authors email address matches the address of a previously approved comment, otherwise, the comment is held for moderation. Comments from blacklisted email addresses (those listed in the Local Spam Words Text Box) are held for moderation regardless of whitelist status. </p><h3>Comment Moderation </h3><p>In the Comment Moderation section you specify these options to help you deal with Comment Spam.</p><p>Hold a comment in the queue if it contains X or more links (A common characteristic of comment spam is a large number of hyperlinks.) Not too long ago, comment spammers would have five, ten, or more hyperlinks in their comment spam. This made it very easy for bloggers to quickly screen comments but spammers recognized that and commonly use only one or two hyperlinks. You can enter a number in this box to tell WordPress how many links you allow in a comment before holding it for moderation. </p><p>When a comment contains any of these words in its content, name, URL, email, or IP, it will be held in the moderation queue. One word or IP per line. It will match inside words, so press will match WordPress  In this text box you can add your own spam words which will filter the comments when posted. For an extensive and updated list of frequently used spam words and phrases click the link to the article on Spam Words; consider adding these to your own list. </p><h3>Comment Blacklist </h3><p>When a comment contains any of these words in its content, name, URL, email, or IP, it will be marked as spam. One word or IP per line. It will match inside words, so press will match WordPress. This text box acts the same as When a comment conatins any of these words... except comments which match these words will be deleted without warning. You may want to use this as a last resort, as genuine comments can end up deleted (WordPress 1.5 and later) </p><h3>Avatars</h3><p>An avatar is an image that follows you from weblog to weblog appearing beside your name when you comment on avatar enabled sites. Here you can enable the display of avatars for people who comment on your blog. By default WordPress uses Gravatars, short for Globally Recognized Avatars, for the pictures that show up next to comments. Plugins may override this. </p><h3>Avatar display </h3><p>Do not show Avatars to suppress avatar display in comments.</p><p>Show Avatars so comment author avatars are displayed along with the comments. </p><h3>Maximum Rating </h3><p>This setting controls (or limits) the highest level or rating of gravatar you allow to be displayed. G is Suitable for all audiences PG is Possibly offensive, usually for audiences 13 and above R is Intended for adult audiences above 17 X is Even more mature than above </p><h3>Default Avatar</h3><p>For users without a custom avatar of their own, you can either display a generic logo or a generated one based on their email address.</p><p>Available are Mystery Man, Blank, Gravatar Logo, Identicon (Generated), Wavatar (Generated), MonsterID (Generated) and Retro (Generated).</p>';
$more_permalink = '<p>By default, WordPress uses web URLs which have question marks and lots of numbers in them; however, WordPress offers you the ability to create a custom URL structure for your permalinks and archives. This can improve the aesthetics, usability, and forward-compatibility of your links.</p><p>A note about performance: Permalink structures beginning with %category%, %tag%, %author%, or %postname%, require more server resources to resolve than structures such as, Day and Name, Month and Name, and %post_id%-%postname%, though as of 3.3 the %postname% structure is usable.</p><h3>Customize Permalink Structure</h3><p>A number of tags are available, and here are some examples to get you started.</p><h3>Common settings</h3><p>Check one of the radio buttons corresponding to the correct Permalink Structure for your blog. </p><p>Default - An example of the default structure is http://www.sample.com/?p=123 </p><p>Day and name - An example of the day and name based structure is http://www.sample.com/2008/03/31/sample-post/ </p><p>Month and name - An example of the month and name based structure is http://www.sample.com/2008/03/sample-post/ </p><p>Numeric - An example of the numeric structure is http://www.sample.com/archives/123 </p><p>Post name - An example of the post name structure is http://www.sample.com/sample-post </p><p>Custom structure - In the box specify the custom structure you desire to use. One example is /archives/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/. Look at the Using Permalinks article for further discussion of Permalink Structure Tags. </p><h3>Optional</h3><p>You may enter custom bases for your category and tag URLs here. For example, using /topics/ as your category base would make your category links like http://example.org/topics/uncategorized/. If you leave these blank the defaults will be used. Again, see the Using Permalinks article for further discussion of Permalink Structure Tags.</p><p>Category base - Enter a custom prefix for your category URLs here.</p><p>Tag base - Enter a custom prefix for your tag URLs here. </p><h3>Save Changes</h3><p>Click the Save Changes button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database. Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved. After youve clicked this button, you should receive one of two messages depending on whether your .htaccess file is writeable. </p><p>If .htaccess is writeable, you will get a message that says Permalink structure updated. Youre all set; WordPress has been able to do everything for you automatically.</p><p>If .htaccess is not writeable, you will see a message at the top of the screen that says You should update your .htaccess now.. Near the bottom of the screen you will see If your .htaccess file were writable, we could do this automatically, but it is not so these are the mod_rewrite rules you should have in your .htaccess file. Click in the field and press CTRL + a to select all. This means youll have to do one extra step yourself. In the text box at the bottom of the Screen, WordPress displays several lines of rewrite rules associated with the Permalink Structure you designated above. You need to manually copy everything in this text box into your .htaccess file to make your new Permalinks work. </p><p>Visiting the Permalinks screen triggers a flush of rewrite rules. There is no need to save just to flush the rewrite rules. </p><p>If youre writing your .htaccess file on your own local computer, remember, some operating systems do not allow the creation of a file named .htaccess because of the initial dot (.). You can always name the file without the initial dot or with a standard extension (e.g. htaccess.txt). Once the file is uploaded to your weblogs directory, rename it with your FTP software. Most FTP Clients should provide you a way to rename filesthis. </p><p>Files that begin with a dot (.) like .htaccess are hidden on most servers by default. Consult the userguide or FAQ of the FTP software you use to find out how to have the software display these hidden files, and also how to use the software to change file permissions, rename files, etc. </p>';
